This 'project' started as a small 1-2 day exercise to discover more about the foreground services in Android but turned into usable workout app. 
Project's focus point is aimed recording the workout's:
* distance
* duration
* steps
* play/pause
* stop

Here are some comparisons with the official Huawei app which offers consistant readings throughout my workout sessions (over 4k kilometers).

Long run:

Difference in duration is the pauses which this app takes into account.
Minimum steps difference (cooldown and walking) in taken brakes.
Known issue is the initial inaccuracies when workout is started so the entire time the difference was like at the end.

Short run:

Identical distance recorded in the shorter run.
